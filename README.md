# End to End Data Science Project.
🏠 California House Price Prediction
📈 End-to-End Machine Learning Project | Streamlit App | Deployed Ready

This project predicts the median house value in California based on various housing and demographic features such as income, age, location, and proximity to the ocean.

It’s a complete ML pipeline project — from data ingestion to model training, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit.

🚀 Project Workflow

The pipeline follows a modular architecture:

Data Ingestion → Data Transformation → Model Training → Model Evaluation → Streamlit App


Each stage is implemented as a separate component inside the src/ folder.

🧠 Key Features

✅ End-to-End ML pipeline using modular components
✅ Data cleaning, transformation, and scaling
✅ Model training & evaluation with multiple regressors
✅ Automatic model selection based on R² Score
✅ Streamlit web app for live predictions
✅ Logging & Exception handling integrated
✅ Artifacts (raw, train, test, model, preprocessor) saved automatically
